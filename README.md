TRIVIA TIME

Overview

This is a trivia web app in which users will answer 5 questions of multiple choice answers on their subject of choice. As the user progresses, the question counter and the score will update. When they finish, the user gets a final message along with their final score, as well as the restart button so they can play again.

Tech/Purpose

The project was built using REACT.js as a practicing opportunity as well as a portfolio addition. 

Challenges

The challenges of this project were mainly:
*  Using FETCH API in a project for the first time
*  Organizing the data received and distributing it to their allotted places randomly 
*   Learning React Router and how to apply it
*   Using React Hooks like useEffect and UseState as well as learning useReff and useHistory

Improvement

Future features I would like to implement are:
*  Updating fetch to use Async/Await
* Soft code some areas that currently aren't optimal
*  Learn how to write better implementations of the data received from fetch
