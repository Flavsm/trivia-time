# TRIVIA TIME

## Overview

In this trivia web app, users answer 5 multiple choice questions in the subject of their choosing. As the user progresses, the question counter and the score will update. After the 5 questions are answered, the user will receive a message and their final score. The user will also have the option to press the 'restart' button and play again. The main stack used is REACT.js.

## Purpose

This project started as a way to practice applying REACT to real apps, and it has been added to my portfolio.

## Challenges

The challenges of this project were mainly:
*  Using FETCH API in a project for the first time
*  Organizing the data received and distributing it to their allotted places randomly 
*  Learning React Router and how to apply it
*  Using React Hooks like useEffect and UseState as well as learning useReff and useHistory

## Improvement

Future features I would like to implement are:
*  Updating fetch to use Async/Await
*  Soft code some areas that currently aren't optimal
*  Better ways of distributing the data received from fetch
