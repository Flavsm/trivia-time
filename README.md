# LET'S GET QUIZZICAL

## Overview

In this trivia web app, users answer 5 multiple choice questions on the subject of their choosing. As the user progresses, the question counter and the score will update. After the 5 questions are answered, the user will receive a message and their final score. The user will also have the option to play again. Main stacks are JS and React

## Purpose

This is a personal project, built with the intent of practicing React.

## Challenges

The challenges of this project were mainly:
*  Using Fetch for the first time
*  Handling the fetched data 
*  Learning React Router 

## Improvement

Future features I would like to implement are:
*  Use Async/Await
